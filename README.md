# Videogames Classification

This project was done for a first year curricular unit (Elementos de Inteligência Artificial e Ciência de Dados).

Using Jupyter Notebook and Python, I trained a couple models to predict the ratings of several video games.<br>
This was a simple classification task that allowed for a taste of the challenges faced in data pre-processing and model training.<br>
This was the first time developing a project of this sort, and was done to experiment with Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, MatPlot-Lib, Seaborn, ...
